# VecDraw
Vector graphic editor licensed with Unlicense. It is being written as training project on window application programming course. It's not perfect as I wanted but it works.

## Wanna write off my code?
No problem. I wish you could understand it...

## Caught a bug?
Well... You can send add an issue into my repo.
Or just use Telegram: my nickname is \@autist.

## Tasks:
1. Pencil (done)
2. Simple tools (done)
3. Zooming and moving a canvas (done)
4. Rounded rectangle tool (done)
5. Polygon tool (done)
- others coming soon 

## TODO list:
- **REFACTORING!** Seriously, this code looks a bit awful.
