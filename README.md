# VecDraw [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/t1meshift/VecDraw.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/t1meshift/VecDraw)
Vector graphic editor licensed with Unlicense. It is being written as training project on window application programming course. It's not perfect as I wanted but it works.
## Requires FPC 3.0.2+ to compile a project! 
If you don't want to download Lazarus to see how it works, you can check out the binaries for Windows and Linux on [Releases page](https://github.com/t1meshift/VecDraw/releases).

## Wanna write off my code?
No problem. I wish you could understand it...

## How about Linux compilation?
At least it compiles and works. Tested with Lazarus 1.6.4 x86_64 on the latest Manjaro.

## Caught a bug?
Well... You can send add an issue into my repo.
Or just use Telegram: my nickname is \@autist.

## Travis-CI? For educational project written in Object Pascal? You must be kidding me!
Well, I find it something funny. I've configured CI system because I can! :octocat:
