# VecDraw
Vector graphic editor licensed with Unlicense. It is being written as training project on window application programming course. It's not perfect as I wanted but it works.

## Wanna write off my code?
No problem. I wish you could understand it...

## How about Linux compilation?
At least it compiles and works. Tested with Lazarus 1.6.4 x86_64 on the latest Manjaro.

## Caught a bug?
Well... You can send add an issue into my repo.
Or just use Telegram: my nickname is \@autist.
